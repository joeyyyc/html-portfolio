<h1>Best Animes According to Joey</h1>

<h2>Top 3 Animes of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>

<p>
  The plot is really interesting and the main characters are wholesome. <br />
  My favourite character is Zoro as he is very badass in a cool way.
</p>

<h3>Haikyuu</h3>

<p>
  I love watching the volleyball matches and the character development behind my
  favourite characters, Hinata and Kageyama. <br />
  The team spirit is hyped and I like to see how they never give up and
  persevere on.
</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>

<p>
  The animation is the best out of all the animes I have watched. <br />
  The comedy is spot-on and the action is really gooooooood.
